R-Box package for Sublime Text 3
------------

It is a next generation of the R package
[Enhanced-R](https://github.com/randy3k/Enhanced-R). I have refactored the
original code and the old settings are not compatible with the current setup,
so I decided to create a new repo for it.

This package contains a extended version of the R syntax
definition, so you do not have to install
any syntax definitions for R (and savely disable the default `R` package). 
However, if you are only interested in the syntax definitions, you can just visit [here](https://github.com/randy3k/R-Extended).

Features:

  1. Multi platform support (windows/mac/linux)
  2. Send commands to various applicaionts (R gui, Terminal, iTerm 2, screen, tmux...)
  3. Function hints in status bar
  4. Autocompletions for base R commands
  5. more to be discovered

### Getting start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/randy3k/R-Box /path/to/sublime/packages/
```

It is still under development and nothing near to be finished.
There is no roadmap when it will be released, but I will do it eventually.

### Usage

Send Command to GUI/Terminals.
