R-Box package for Sublime Text 3
------------

It is a next generation of the R package [Enhanced-R](https://github.com/randy3k/Enhanced-R). I have refactored the original code and the old settings are not compatible with the current setup, so I decided to create a new repo for it.

This package contains a extended version of the [R syntax definition](https://github.com/randy3k/R-Extended).

### Getting start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/randy3k/R-Box /path/to/sublime/packages/
```

It is still under development and nothing near to be finished.
There is no roadmap when to release it to [package control](https://sublime.wbond.net) yet, but I will do it eventually.

### Usage

Send Command to GUI/Terminals.
